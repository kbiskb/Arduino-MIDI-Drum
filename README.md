#Abstract
This project demonstrates how to use piezo transducer and Arduino to create a simple electronic drum set which connects to the MIDI software in computer. The purpose of this project is that using cheap common materials and Arduino board to building an percussion instrument device which connect to the MIDI software in the computer in order to simulate the a electronic drum set. This page is going to showcase that the preparation for this project, as well as the procedure of parts assembly, coding and the connecting of each software.
